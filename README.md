# IoT Project NTU

This is an IoT project made for the class Introduction to Internet of Things at National Taiwan University.
We make use of Arduino, Bluetooth, Azure DB, Power BI and Azure ML.
Here you can find a PDF explaining the project and the code we use for making it.

Basically, What we did was:
1. Using an Arduino UNO and a few sensors to get temperature, humidity to try to know the Precipitacion Probability.
2. Send this information by Bluetooth to a Raspberry Pi 3
3. Send this information from Raspberri Pi 3 to Azure Machine Learning Studio Service (We use the Weather ML they already had)
4. Save the results.
5. Make a representation of our data by using PowerBI.
